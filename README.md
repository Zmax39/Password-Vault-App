# Password-Vault-App

<h2 align='center'> ABOUT </h2>

<p>This is the Password Vault app I created for my brothers computer because he kept forgetting all of his passwords.</p>

<p align ='center'>To create this application, I used Python and sqlite3 database.</p>

<p> I imported tkinter module so I was able to create a Graphical User Interface (GUI) and the 
Database was used to store the Master Password to gain entry to the program and to store the saved details.</p>

Once the program is initialised, The user is prompted to either 'Create a Master Password' if it is the first run, or to "Enter Password' if they have already set a Password - The user entry will be checked against the value stored in the Database and either allow access or return an appropriate message.

Once the user is logged in, they can view their saved - Website, Username, and Password which is stored in table format in the Database, they can add entries, or they can delete entries.

<h2 align='center'> HOW TO USE </h2>
To use this program, fork this repo to your local machine and either run it using terminal/cmd or save it as an app on your desktop to run when you choose from a shortcut.
